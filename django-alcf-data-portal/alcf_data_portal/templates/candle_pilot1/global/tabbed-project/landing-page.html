    Predictive models for cancer therapy can one day support the treatment choices
    a physician and patient make toward achieving the best possible clinical outcome.
    A team of collaborators from the DOE and NCI aims to accelerate this by using
    advanced computation to rapidly develop, test, and validate predictive pre-clinical
    models for precision oncology. They used observational data from experiments with
    cancer cell lines and animal models to do statistical analysis, deep learning,
    modeling, and simulation on Theta. This project has developed a suite of machine
    learning models for both single drugs and drug combinations, and became the first
    group to apply deep residual networks (DRN) to predict drug response both for single
    drugs and for multiple drugs.
